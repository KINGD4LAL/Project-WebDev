        Advanced Programming is going to be more Java, including: file handling,
        networking, database integration and web services.This unit tasks you with working on 
        industry-inspired problems involving the creation of moderately complex software solutions.
        You will gain practical experience of documenting and testing existing code, as well as creating 
        applications using a variety of libraries, tools, design patterns and techniques.

                This unit furthers your web development knowledge and skills, tasking you with studying
                client-side and server-side web development languages, platforms, tools and technologies
                to create complete web applications.
                Full-stack web development is the development of both the front-end and back-end of a
                website or application. A good full-stack web developer will have the necessary skills to
                program a browser, a server and also have knowledge of frameworks and any other coding
                niches, that their job entails.

            Thematic Project will involve making a piece of software as a group,
            similar to the Group Project in the First Year of the course. You will be expected to do more
            technical coding learnt in second year, but you'll still have control over what
            tools/languages are being used. The thematic project will allow you to further develop your project management, team working 
            and communication skills by applying those skills to a given industry, or research, inspired project. Wider aspects such as social, security, ethical and 
            legal issues will be embedded in the project work where appropriate.
