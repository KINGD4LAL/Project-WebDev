        <p class="InfoPara">
            In this unit, you will study a variety of contemporary software verification and testing tools and techniques.
            You will gain experience testing various aspects of a systems behaviour using 
            industry-standard test automation tools and strategies. Software Testing & Quality Assurance is also going to be about how we go
            about finding bugs in software. It will cover various testing approaches and tools, covering several languages.

            <p class="InfoPara">
                The synoptic project allows you to consolidate your learning from your degree programme into a final project, 
                bringing together ideas and techniques from throughout your study. 
                From this project, you will produce the centrepiece of their degree work portfolio.
                will involve knowledge and skills from across the course. You'll get a short (2-3 paragraph) project brief, and have to
                develop the idea into a proper finished product, negotiating with your supervisor over how things should work, how it should be designed etc.

            <p class="InfoPara">
                You will architect scalable software solutions using commercially available cloud infrastructure. You will learn to make informed decisions on which 
                cloud provider is most suitable for a project based on cost or technical suitability.
                 In addition, you will gain experience of developing software using the tools and published documentation of a platform provider.
                 This will involve some study of the virtualisation technologies that make the cloud work, as well as some development of 
                 software using a commercial cloud service platform using their APIs and tools.
